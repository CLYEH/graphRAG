"""Query guardrail strategy vocabulary (DESIGN §21/§27.6, Track 0 P5).

Freezes the *strategy* the guardrail implementations (C6b sql, C6c graph) are
built against — the executable validators land with those tasks, but the
vocabularies they enforce are contract and live here, mirrored by
``contracts/query_policy.schema.json`` (contract tests assert the two never
drift):

- **SQL** (§27.6): parse with sqlglot into an AST *before* execution — string
  matching alone is not validation. Reject on: parse failure, more than one
  statement, any table outside ``allowed_tables``, any DDL/DML. The blocked
  keyword list is defense in depth on top of the AST check;
  ``SQL_BLOCKED_KEYWORDS_MIN`` is §21's frozen minimum (extend, never shrink).
- **Cypher** (§27.6): MCP graph tools default to parameterized query
  templates (``GRAPH_QUERY_TEMPLATES``); free NL→Cypher is optional and, when
  enabled, restricted by a Cypher parser to ``CYPHER_ALLOWED_CLAUSES`` —
  nothing outside that universe can ever be whitelisted. ``CYPHER_BLOCKED_MIN``
  is §21's frozen minimum; blocking ``CALL`` bans every procedure, APOC
  included.

Violations are rejected with the typed ``GUARDRAIL_BLOCKED`` warning (§21) —
``GUARDRAIL_WARNING_CODE`` is pinned to the frozen §27.2 warning enum by a
contract test.

    ``contracts/query_policy.schema.json`` already validates a policy document
    structurally; this is the in-code value the executing seam holds, and it
    RE-CHECKS at construction the three frozen §21 guarantees the guardrail
    actually relies on — so a policy that somehow reached here malformed fails
    loud instead of silently under-guarding (the value-validation discipline of
    :mod:`core.query.results`):

    - ``readonly`` is frozen ``True`` — a writable NL→SQL path is forbidden and

    - ``blocked_keywords`` covers :data:`SQL_BLOCKED_KEYWORDS_MIN` — a project

    - an ``enabled`` mode has a non-empty ``allowed_tables`` — an enabled empty
      whitelist is a deny-all contradiction (use ``enabled=False`` for that).

    The row/latency reconciliation with the top-level ``max_sql_rows`` /
    ``max_latency_ms`` is the caller's job (C6b takes an already-reconciled
    ``max_rows``); this block carries the sql-mode-local caps.
